          <p>
            I have been building web apps for the past 5 years. I enjoy building
            the frontend and backend equally.
          </p>
          <p>
            I read a lot of books in my free time, mostly sci-fi, fantasy and
            non-fiction about tech. I love to run and exercise. I am into hiking
            and calisthenics and I have played highly competitive soccer my
            entire life.
          </p>
          <p>
            My goal with this website is just for it to be a playground for me
            to build things I like and write about topics I find interesting.

          <p>
            I&apos;m a developer with a passion for creating meaningful
            projects, both on the frontend and backend. Since graduating in
            2019, I&apos;ve been working as a software engineer, building
            solutions that make an impact.
          </p>
          <p>
            Beyond coding, I&apos;m deeply passionate about sports and books. I
            could spend a whole day watching soccer or NFL, or reading an epic
            fantasy book.
          </p>
          <p>
            I&apos;m also endlessly curious about how people live their lives in
            different parts of the world. Traveling with my girlfriend allows us
            to explore, experience new cultures, and satisfy that curiosity. You
            can check out our adventures on{" "}

            This website is my little corner of the internet where I share the
            things I create and write about topics that inspire me. I&apos;m
            constantly updating and redesigning itâ€”not just to make it look
            better but also to learn and grow as a developer along the way. Hope
            you enjoy it!
